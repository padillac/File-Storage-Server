# File-Storage-Server

A file storage client/server system that allows for easy, networked file transfer and management.


## Server

1. Configure up fileserver.conf file, and make sure it sits in the same directory as fileserver.py.

2. Run fileserver.py


## Client

1. Optionally set up an alias so fileclient.py can be called from anywhere, and to avoid typing the same hostname/port over and over.

2. Run fileclient.py and see usage/help menu
